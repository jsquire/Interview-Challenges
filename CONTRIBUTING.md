# Contribution Guidelines #

At present, outside contributions are limited to ideas for new challenges and feedback around bugs and enhancement opportunities.  Please offer any suggestions or problems by opening issues on the repository. 

The intention is to open this project for contributions in the future, once patterns are firmly established and guidance is formally set.  Currently, things are in the early stages of design and execution, with non-trivial changes in direction expected to continue in the near-term.  As a result, I don't believe that there is yet sufficient stability for additional contributors.
